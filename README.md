# Slider Slick

This is a simple project that demonstrates how to create an image slider using the Slick Carousel plugin. The slider is an image gallery that automatically changes, displaying one image at a time. The transition effect between images is smooth, and you can add navigation dots to indicate how many images exist and the user's current position in the gallery.

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- jQuery
- Slick Carousel

## Features

## Additional Notes

- The slider is styled to display 6 circular images with different background colors. You can add or remove slides as needed, just make sure to adjust the CSS to display the added images correctly.
- The Slick Carousel plugin is loaded via a Content Delivery Network (CDN), so an internet connection is required for it to work correctly.
